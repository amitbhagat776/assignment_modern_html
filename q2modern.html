<!-- HTML entities are special characters that can be used to represent
     reserved characters in HTML. Reserved characters in HTML are characters 
     that have special meaning to the browser, such as the less than (<) and greater than (>) signs.

To use an HTML entity, simply type the entity name or entity number between an ampersand (&) and a semicolon (;). For example, to display the less than sign on a web page, you would type &lt; or &#60;.
Here are 5 commonly used HTML entities:

    &lt; - Less than sign (<)
    &gt; - Greater than sign (>)
    &amp; - Ampersand (&)
    &quot; - Double quotation mark (")
    &apos; - Single quotation mark (') -->
